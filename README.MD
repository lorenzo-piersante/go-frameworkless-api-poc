### 💡 Project idea
In this project i want to create a frameworkless API written in GO to improve my skills with this amazing language and try to understand some API concepts at a deeper level.

My main goal is to keep the project as simple as possible while exploring some topics wich are normally handled (sometimes in magical ways) and hidden from frameworks to the developer like http comunication or authentication/authorization.

### 👨🏻‍💻 Coming next
Next developments will be:
- Test everything with GO builtin testing tools
- Create the first real route for user authentication using JWT
- Add GORM and learn how to use it
- Create a route with some parallelizable tasks to learn goroutines
- Add a docker-compose file
